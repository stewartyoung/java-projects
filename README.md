### Abstract
I have noticed whilst taking my MSc Computer Science degree at Warwick that the best way to learn a language is to set yourself up with appropriate problems to help you actively learn the fundamentals of the language i.e. classes, functions, strings, array, inputs, output etc etc. This is the purpose of this repository, and hopefully doing the same problems for other languages allows me to get to grips with a language much quicker.  
For example, before my next React.js project, I could do these problems in Node.js to refresh on the different data structures required to proceed with building out a website or a server.

## Problem 1: Hello World (HelloNameAndAge)
Your challenge is to build a class that takes the users name and age as command line argumenents and return then as print statements to the command line.

## Problem 2: College Cost App (CollegeCost)
Your challenge is to write a program that cimputes the total yearly cost for a student in college.
* Dorm or commuting?
* Duration of stay
* Estimated cost of dorm and off-campus accomodation options per week  
As well as: 
* Name
* Age
* Level of study (Masters, PhD, Undergrad)
* Year of study 
* Cost of supplies per week   
**Note: Whilst building the app, make sure to create different methods for each request, and call these methods in the main function**
